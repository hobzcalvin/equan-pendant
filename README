This repository should be placed in a boards/ directory which is next to
the pcbmode/ directory. From the level above that, run:

> python pcbmode/pcbmode.py -b equan-pendant -m
> python pcbmode/pcbmode.py -b equan-pendant --fab oshpark

Then you can compress everything created in
boards/equan-pendant/build/production and upload it to OSH Park!
